1. What is Feedforward Neural Networks?

Question: What is a feedforward neural network?

Answer: A feedforward neural network is one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks. In this model, information moves in only one directionâ€”from the input layer, through the hidden layers (if any), to the output layer. There are no cycles or loops in the network. Each layer consists of neurons, and each neuron applies a weighted sum of its inputs followed by a non-linear activation function. Feedforward neural networks are commonly used for tasks like classification and regression.



2. What are Keras and TensorFlow?
Question: What are Keras and TensorFlow?

Answer:

TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Google. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem for building and deploying machine learning models. TensorFlow allows for both high-level and low-level programming, giving users flexibility and control over model design.
Keras is a high-level API for building neural networks that can run on top of TensorFlow (and other backends like Theano). It simplifies the process of creating and training neural networks by providing user-friendly functions and classes. Keras is particularly popular among beginners and for rapid prototyping due to its ease of use.



3. What is Training and Testing Data (MNIST/CIFAR10)?
Question: What are training and testing data? Can you explain using MNIST and CIFAR10?

Answer:

Training Data is the portion of the dataset used to train the model. It helps the model learn the patterns and features of the input data. The model adjusts its parameters based on this data.
Testing Data is a separate portion of the dataset used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. It checks how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits (0-9) containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. It is commonly used for image classification tasks.

CIFAR10 is a dataset of 60,000 images in 10 different classes (such as airplanes, cars, birds, etc.), with 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. It presents a more complex challenge compared to MNIST due to the variety of objects and their backgrounds.


4. Epochs :-
Epochs refer to the number of complete passes through the entire training dataset during the training of a machine learning model.


Example:
Suppose you have a dataset with 1,000 samples, and you set a batch size of 100:

Each epoch will involve the model going through 10 batches (1,000 samples / 100 samples per batch).
After 10 batches, one epoch is complete, and all samples have been processed once.
If you train for 5 epochs, the model will process all 1,000 samples 5 times, each time updating its weights and improving its learning.

Why Use Multiple Epochs?
Training a model for more than one epoch allows it to learn more and refine its parameters by iteratively adjusting based on the dataset.
